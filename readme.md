## Project Overview
In this project, you will create a web-based application that converts text transcripts or audio uploads into enhanced, playable podcasts using ReactJS, ExpressJS, Google's Gemini API, and Web Speech API. Your application will demonstrate the integration of modern web technologies and AI to streamline podcast creation.

## Real-World Relevance
This project mirrors real-world tasks developers often encounter, such as:

- **AI Integration**: Working with AI technologies like Google's Gemini API to transform text and audio data.
- **Web Development**: Building a full-stack application using ReactJS for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend.
- **Audio Processing**: Utilizing the Web Speech API for text-to-audio conversion, a crucial skill in media and entertainment industries.

## Objectives
- **Use ReactJS**: Develop the frontend using ReactJS to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Use ExpressJS**: Implement the backend with ExpressJS to handle API requests and manage data flow.
- **AI and Audio Processing**: Integrate Google's Gemini API and Web Speech API for text transformation and audio generation.
- **User Interaction**: Design an intuitive podcast player interface with basic controls like Start and Stop.
- **Data Handling**: Implement functionality for audio file uploads and transcript input.

## Requirements
- **API Usage**: Must use Google's Gemini API and Web Speech API for AI and audio processing.
- **Interactivity**: The app should allow users to upload audio files or input transcripts and generate podcasts.
- **Presentation**: The application should display the generated podcast script and provide playback controls.

## Getting Started
1. **Set Up the Environment**: Clone the repository and set up your development environment with Node.js and npm.
2. **Explore APIs**: Familiarize yourself with Google's Gemini API and Web Speech API.
3. **Plan Your Application**: Outline the user flow and design the UI components.
4. **Development**: Implement the core features, including API integration and audio processing.
5. **Testing**: Ensure the application functions correctly and handles errors gracefully.

## Submission
- **Code Review**: Submit your code for review and ensure it meets the project requirements.
- **Presentation**: Demonstrate your application, highlighting key features and discussing any challenges faced during development.
