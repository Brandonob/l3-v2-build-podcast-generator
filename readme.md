## Context
This project will create a prototype similar to [Google's Notebook LM podcast feature](https://notebooklm.google.com/), demonstrating your ability to work with modern web technologies and AI integration.

## Project Overview
Create a web-based application that converts text transcripts or audio uploads into enhanced, playable podcasts from one or two people using ReactJS, ExpressJS, Google's Gemini API, and Web Speech API. This prototype will showcase your ability to work with cutting-edge AI and audio processing technologies.

## Project Scope
This is a prototype development project aimed at feasibility and potential of AI-enhanced podcast creation technology used in a real-world application. It is broken into 3 tiers of complexity which are outlined in the [tier.md](tier.md) file.

## Core Features Required
- Audio file upload functionality
- Transcript paste/input capability
- Text-to-Audio conversion using Web Speech API or ElevenLabs
- Text transformation using Gemini API or whatever API you want to use for text transformation
- Podcast player interface with basic audio controls (Start, Stop)
- Generate Podcast button control to trigger the podcast creation process
- Example output of generated podcast script in the UI

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: ReactJS
- Backend: ExpressJS
- AI Integration: Google Gemini API
- Audio Processing: Web Speech API
- Audio Compression: Ffmpeg (optional)
- File Uploads: Multer (optional)
- Additional APIs and/or packages as needed

## Project Deliverables
1. Functional full-stack web application prototype
2. Clean source code


## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization
- API integration effectiveness
- User interface design
- Error handling and user feedback
- Innovation in implementation

## Next Steps
1. Review the technical specification document
2. Research the technologies and tools needed
3. Create a project plan
4. Begin development setup
5. Implement the core features
6. Test and iterate on the prototype
