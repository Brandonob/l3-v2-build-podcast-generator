## Context
Hey developers! LearnNation is looking for innovative solutions to streamline podcast creation using AI technology. This project will create a prototype similar to [Google's Notebook LM podcast feature](https://notebooklm.google.com/), demonstrating your ability to work with modern web technologies and AI integration.

## Project Overview
Create a web-based application that converts text transcripts or audio uploads into enhanced, playable podcasts from one or two people using ReactJS, ExpressJS, Google's Gemini API, and Web Speech API. This prototype will showcase your ability to work with cutting-edge AI and audio processing technologies.

## Project Scope
This is a prototype development project aimed at feasibility and potential of LearnNation's Proprietary AI-enhanced podcast creation technology. The successful implementation could lead to opportunities to join the full Proprietary AI development team.

## Core Features Required
- Audio file upload functionality
- Transcript paste/input capability
- Text-to-Audio conversion using Web Speech API
- Text transformation using Gemini API
- Podcast player interface with basic audio controls (Start, Stop)
- Generate Podcast button control to trigger the podcast creation process
- Example output of generated podcast script in the UI

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: ReactJS
- Backend: ExpressJS
- AI Integration: Google Gemini API
- Audio Processing: Web Speech API
- Audio Compression: Ffmpeg (optional)
- File Uploads: Multer (optional)
- Additional APIs and/or packages as needed

## Project Deliverables
1. Functional full-stack web application prototype
2. Clean source code


## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization
- API integration effectiveness
- User interface design
- Error handling and user feedback
- Innovation in implementation

## Next Steps
1. Review the technical specification document
2. Research the technologies and tools needed
3. Create a project plan
4. Begin development setup
5. Implement the core features
6. Test and iterate on the prototype
